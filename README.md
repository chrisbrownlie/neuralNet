# neuralNet
Implementing neural networks in Python from scratch or with minimal dependencies.

This repository is for me to experiment implementing various neural network architectures in Python 'from scratch' (without the use of a machine learning library).
I aim to add to this repo over time with different network architectures. I am not aiming for this code to be used in production so efficiency is not an initial consideration and understanding the methods is my main priority. 
At a later date I may return and try to clean up the code and speed up execution.

# Plans
To begin with I aim to implement a basic, feedforward network with a single hidden layer (basic.py). 
Following this I will look at the very basics of different architectures such as simple convolutional and recurrent networks. Once I have completed basic implementations I will build on these to develop different variations of each.

# Feedback
If you have any feedback or spot any errors in my code please do not hesitate to get in touch!
